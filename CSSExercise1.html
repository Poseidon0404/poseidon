      </h1>

        Japanese people use this noun to refer to an apple or apples. Its kanji expression is very difficult not only for Japanese learners, but for Japanese people as well. So, the hiragana expression is very acceptable. It’s also worth mentioning here that the katakana expression,
        <strong> “リンゴ”, is sometimes used..</strong>
