            <p>This silky top is what my 10-year-old self imagined I’d wear as a grown up, hosting dinner parties and swooping into rooms with glasses of bubbly. Now that I am grown up, I still find the look effortlessly chic and would love to wear it on repeat this season. For something more laid-back, how great is this checked sweater with contrasting stripes?</p>

              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>A weekend hobby for Joanna Goddard turned into a full-time job. She started A Cup of Jo in 2007 and became a superstar lifestyle blogger. In fact, the site is barely a personal blog anymore, as Jo now has a team of professional writers who share her interests, such as style, design, food, and motherhood.</p>
