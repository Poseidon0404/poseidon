    <h1>The brief history of Japan</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><em>Japan</em> was settled about 35,000 years ago by Paleolithic people from the Asian mainland. At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a culture called the Jomon developed. Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels. According to DNA analysis, the Ainu people may be descendants of the Jomon.
        The second wave of settlement by the Yayoi people introduced metal-working, rice cultivation, and weaving to Japan. DNA evidence suggests that these settlers came from Korea.
        The first era of recorded history in Japan is the Kofun (A.D. 250-538), which was characterized by large burial mounds or tumuli. The Kofun were headed by a class of aristocratic warlords; they adopted many Chinese customs and innovations.

    <h2>i. Ancient Japan</h2>
    <p>
       <em>Ancient Japan</em> has made unique contributions to world culture which include the Shinto religion and its architecture, distinctive art objects such as haniwa figurines, the oldest pottery vessels in the world, the largest wooden buildings anywhere at their time of construction, and many literary classics including the world's first novel. Although Japan was significantly influenced by China and Korea, the islands were never subject to foreign political control and so were free to select those ideas which appealed to them, adapt them how they wished, and to continue with their indigenous cultural practices to create a unique approach to government, religion, and the arts.

    <h2>ii.Classic Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>The Heian</em> period (794–1185) is a critical period of <samp>Japanese history</samp>. Although the cultural heritage imparted by China and the early Korean states remains a part of Japan, distinct and sophisticated Japanese cultural forms emerged during this period.
        <br>The new capital city was situated in a nation with an estimated population of 5 million people. Heian, by the millennium, had a population of around 100,000, making it larger than any European city of the time but significantly smaller than the Chinese capital of Chang'an or classical Rome.

    <h2>iii. Feudal Japan</h2>
    <p>
        Being a warrior in <em>Feudal Japan</em> was more than just a job. It was a way of life. <br>The collapse of aristocratic rule ushered in a new age of chaos appropriately called the Warring States period (c.1400-1600) — in which military might dictated who governed and who followed. The samurai warriors, also known as bushi, took as their creed what later became known as the "Way of the Warrior" (Bushidô), a rigid value system of discipline and honor that required them to live and die in the service of their lords.

    <h2>iv. Early Modern Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Early Modern Japanese</em> <dfn>(近世日本語, kinsei nihongo)</dfn>was the stage of the Japanese language after Middle Japanese and before Modern Japanese.[1] It is a period of transition that shed many of the language's medieval characteristics and became closer to its modern form. The period spanned roughly 250 years and extended from the 17th century to the first half of the 19th century. Politically, it generally corresponded to the Edo period.
    </p>

    <h2>v. Modern Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Modern Japanese Culture:</em> International, adaptive, technology-oriented. Modern Japanese Culture is mainly defined by Western ideologies. With the advancement of technology, Japan has been capitalizing on being one of the leading nations. They prioritize change and are always looking for something different. This does not mean that they will leave the old behind, instead, those core ideas are incorporated into modern Japan values.
