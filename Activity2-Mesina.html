        1. Open Git Bash.
        
        2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

        3. Create a folder specifically for your project

        5. $ git commit -m <mark>"first commit</mark> 
        For projects that already have some code files written and ready to go, the initial commit usually includes all of those code files in one big chunk.



        6. $ git branch <mark>-M main</mark> 
        <dfn>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.</dfn> 


        
        7. $ git remote <mark>add origin</mark> <cite>https://github.com/Poseidon0404/poseidon</cite>
        <dfn> git remote add command will create a new connection record to a remote repository</dfn>


       
        8. $ git push <mark>-u origin main</mark>
